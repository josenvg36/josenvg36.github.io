            <h1>My Journey Building the FDF Project at 42 Academy</h1>
            <p>Embarking on the FDF project at 42 Academy has been an exhilarating journey, filled with challenges and rewarding moments. This blog post captures my experiences, detailing the hurdles I faced, the learning curves I encountered, and the milestones I achieved while building this project.</p>

            <h2>The Initial Struggle: Getting MinilibX to Work</h2>
            <p>The first major hurdle was not merely installing the MinilibX library, but getting it to actually start and run correctly. This step was unexpectedly tricky due to the need for proper configuration, which wasn't straightforward. I spent hours troubleshooting, reading through documentation, and scouring forums for tips on how to set up the library properly. The key was understanding the dependencies and environment settings required to get the graphical window to initialize correctly.</p>

            <h2>Beginning the Project: Opening the Graphical Window</h2>
            <p>Once MinilibX was up and running, the next step was to open a graphical window. This seemed simple in theory, but in practice, it involved understanding how to correctly use the functions provided by MinilibX. Successfully opening a window was a small victory that set the stage for the more complex tasks ahead.</p>

            <h2>Assigning Buttons to Operations</h2>
            <p>Next, I focused on making the application interactive. This involved assigning buttons to certain operations, such as handling scroll events and creating an escape hook to close the window. These operations required a good grasp of how event hooks work in MinilibX. By experimenting with different functions, I managed to get basic interactions working, which was quite satisfying.</p>

            <h2>Drawing Basics: From Pixels to Shapes</h2>
            <p>With the window and basic interactions in place, I began experimenting with drawing on the screen. Starting small, I first learned how to print a single pixel. Building on this, I moved on to drawing lines, then squares. This incremental approach helped me understand the drawing functions in MinilibX.</p>

            <h2>Adding Complexity: Centering and Dot Squared Patterns</h2>
            <p>After mastering the basics, I attempted more complex shapes and patterns. Drawing a centered dot square involved calculations to ensure the shape was perfectly positioned. This exercise was particularly useful in reinforcing my understanding of coordinates and dimensions within the graphical window.</p>

            <h2>Leveraging MinilibX Features</h2>
            <p>As I grew more comfortable with the basics, I started to explore the advanced features of MinilibX. This included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hooks:</strong> Implementing various hooks to handle user inputs and window events.</li>
                <li><strong>Color Properties:</strong> Changing colors dynamically to enhance the visual appeal.</li>
                <li><strong>Window Properties:</strong> Customizing the window to suit the project requirements.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>One of the most satisfying features I added was a ribbon on the left side of the graphical window. This ribbon displayed important information such as coordinates, scale, and currently used colors. Implementing this required a deeper dive into the library's capabilities and a better understanding of how to manage and update the graphical interface efficiently.</p>

            <h2>Current Status and Next Steps</h2>
            <p>As it stands, the project is still a work in progress. There are numerous features I plan to implement and refine. However, the foundation is solid, and I've learned a tremendous amount through the process.</p>

            <p>Building the FDF project at 42 Academy has been a challenging but immensely rewarding experience. From the initial struggles with MinilibX to the satisfaction of creating interactive and dynamic graphical elements, each step has taught me valuable lessons in programming and problem-solving. As I continue to develop this project, I'm excited to see how it evolves and what new challenges and learning opportunities lie ahead.</p>
